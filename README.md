# Embedded-Systems

This is a chill repo for learning embedded systems and sharing progress over time.

## Purpose
- Practice microcontroller programming step by step.
- Keep small experiments and code snapshots.
- Track growth and improvements as I learn.

## Current project
The active firmware project is in:
- `First Code/`

## Quick start
```bash
cd "First Code"
pio run
```

## Notes
This repo is mainly for learning and progress updates, so things may stay simple, messy, or experimental while ideas are tested.

## Merge note
If a platform shows a merge issue, this root `README.md` is the canonical README to keep.
There is no separate project README under `First Code/`.
