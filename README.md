# Embedded-Systems

This is a chill repo for learning embedded systems and sharing progress over time.

## Purpose
- Practice microcontroller programming step by step.
- Keep small experiments and code snapshots.
- Track growth and improvements as I learn.

## Current project
The active firmware project is in:
- `First Code/`

## Quick start
The firmware project is in:

- **`First Code/`**

If you were looking for the README for the code, it is here:

- **`First Code/README.md`**


## Notes
This repo is mainly for learning and progress updates, so things may stay simple, messy, or experimental while ideas are tested.
